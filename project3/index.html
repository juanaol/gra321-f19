    <h1>The History of the Study of Intercultural Communication</h1>
    <h2>The Interpretuve Approach</h2>
    <p>The interpretive approach gained prominence in the late 1980's among communication scholars. One interpretive approach, rooted in sociolinguistics, is the ethnography of communication (Hymes, 1974). Ethnographers of communication are devoted to descriptive studies of communication patterns within specific cultural groups. Interpretive researchers assume not only that reality is external to humans, but also that humans construct reality. They believe that human experience, including communication, is subjective and human behavior is neither predetermined nor easily predicted.</p>
    <p>The goal of interpretive research is to understand and describe human behavior. (predicting human behavior is not a goal.) Whereas social scientist tends to see communication as influenced by culture, the interprevist sees culture as created and maintaines through communication (Carbaugh, 1996). This type of research uses qualitive methods derived from anthropology and linguistics such as field studies, observations and participant observations. An example is shown in Figure 2-2. (A researcher engaging in participant observation contributes actively to the communication process being observed and studied.  The researcher thus is intimately involved in the research and may become good friends with members of the communities he or she is studying.)</p>
    <p>Another example of interpretive research is the rhetorical approach, also used by critical researchers, perhaps the oldest communication scholarship, dating back to the ancient Greeks. Rhetoricans typically examine and analyze texts or public speeches in the contexts in which they occur.</p>
    <p>Cross-cultural psychologists use the terms etic and emic to distinguish the social science and interpretive approaches (Berry, 1997). These terms were borrowed from linguistics-etci from phonetic and emic from phonemic. Social science research usually searches for universal generalizations and studies cultures objectively, with an "outsider's view"; in this way, it is "etic". In contrast, interpretive research usually focuses on understanding phenomena subjectively, from within a particular cultural community or context; in this way, it is "emic". These researchers try to describe patterns or rules that individuals follow in specific contexts. They tend to be more interested in describing cultural behavior in one community than in making cross-cultural comparisons.</p>
